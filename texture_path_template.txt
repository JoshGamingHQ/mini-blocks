{"textures":{"SKIN":{"url":"image file link goes here"}}}

Place the link to the image file in the url space.

Then encode the entire line in base64.

Below is the component you need to edit:

      "minecraft:profile": {
        "properties": [
          {
            "name": "textures",
            "value": "Base64 Encoded Link goes here"
          }
        ]
      }
